# photo_site
Hello there, so this is me getting started with Web Development.
Have done earlier but pushing to Github now as I learnt it's great!

This Photo Blog (Portfolio) just focuses on displaying images in a proper grid like a gallery but only with basic CSS & HTML.
Not using any advanced stuff like Flexbox or Frameworks!
Very very basic, to learn & grow!!
